Here are slides and handout materials for two workshops taught at the University of Pittsburgh Health Library System in spring 2022. "NIH-DataSharing-Session2" covers guidelines for choosing an appropriate data repository for sharing data in compliance with the NIH's new Data Management and Sharing Policy. "NIH-DataSharing-Session3" covers the basics of documentation, metadata, and licensing for all materials (datasets, code, publications, etc.) uploaded to the web.
